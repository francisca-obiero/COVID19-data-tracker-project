# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
The **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** project analyzes and reports on global COVID-19 trends using real-world datasets. This project tracks cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries over time. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to generate meaningful insights into the progression of the pandemic worldwide.

By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive data analysis report with visualizations and narrative explanations suitable for presentation or publication.

## Project Objectives
- Import and clean global COVID-19 datasets.
- Analyze time trends of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across different countries and regions.
- Visualize trends using line charts, bar charts, and optionally choropleth maps.
- Communicate findings clearly in a Jupyter Notebook report.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas - for data loading and manipulation
- matplotlib & seaborn - for data visualization
- Optional: plotly and geopandas - for advanced mapping and interactive visualizations
